Structure your work

On drive M in your assembly directory, create a directory called week9.

Write programs called WEEK90.ASM onwards as outlined below and and save them to the WEEK9 directory.




WEEK90.ASM

Examine the programs pract-a.asm and pract-b.asm from the common drive.

Get each of the above programs to work.

What is the difference if any between the programs?

NB: Carefully Examine the different type of jump operations (for use with unsigned
Numbers) from the file LECT0898.DOC on the common drive. – They are on the very
last page of this document.


WEEK91.ASM

Write a program that will
	-   Read in a number (make sure you call indec to do this)

	-   Check the number against the value 100

	-   If it is < 100 print the message “No entered < 100’ 
	-   If it is > 100 print the message “No entered > 100’ 
	-   If it is = 100 print the message “No entered = 100’ 





WEEK9A.ASM

Carefully go through the notes on the first assembly program in this practical
(prog4.asm). Then assemble and run the first program from this practical.


	
WEEK9B.ASM
		
Carefully go through the notes on the second assembly program in this practical
(prog5.asm). 

Then assemble and run the second program from this practical.


WEEK9C.ASM

Write a short assembly language program to do the following:

Accept a number from the user (use indec).

If the number is greater than 1000 then 
	print the message  “Your number is greater than 1000”

Use values that border on your condition as your test criteria.
I.e. in this example use the values 999,1000, and 1001.



 
WEEK9D.ASM

Write a short assembly language program to do the following:

Accept a number from the user (use indec).
If the number is greater than 1000 then 
	print the message “Your number is greater than 1000”
Else 
	print the message “Your number is less than or equal to 1000”

Use values that border on your condition as your test criteria.
I.e. in this example use the values 999,1000, and 1001.


WEEK9E.ASM

Write a short assembly language program to do the following:

Accept a number from the user (use indec).

If the number is greater than 1000 then 
	print the message	 “Your number is greater than 1000”
	
Else
	If the number is less than 1000 then 
		print the message “Your number is less than 1000”
	Else 
		print the message “Your number is equal to 1000”


Use values that border on your condition as your test criteria.
I.e. in this example use the values 999,1000, and 1001.
