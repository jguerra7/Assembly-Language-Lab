###Week16A.ASM – using the loop instruction 
---
Examine the notes from LECT0998.DOC. Pay particular attention to how the loop instruction works.

Write a program to print the first 10 letters of the alphabet.

You are to use the loop instruction to do this.

Program output:

**ABCDEFGHIJ**

###WEEK16B.ASM
---
Write a program to print the letters of the alphabet backwards.

You are to use the loop instruction to do this.

Program output:

**ZYXW…A**

###WEEK16C.ASM
---
Before you wrote an assembly program to do the following:

-	Accept a number from the user
-	Print a pattern based on the number entered

E.g. user keys in 3

Program prints out

*
**
***

E.g. user keys in 5

Program prints out
*
**
***
****
*****

Modify your program from last week so it uses the loop instruction to perform the inner and outer loops.
