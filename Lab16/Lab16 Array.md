#Lab6 Array 1

Structure your work

On drive M in your assembly directory, create a directory called week16.

Write programs called WEEK16A.ASM onwards as outlined below and and save them to the WEEK16 directory.


##WEEK16A.ASM

Examine the lecture notes from LECT1198.DOC  on arrays.

Make a copy of the program prog11.asm and call the copy week16a.asm.

Get this program to run.


##WEEK16B.ASM

Copy week16a.asm to week16b.asm
The previous program printed out the elements from the array in the reverse order.

Change week16b.asm so the program prints the numbers in the order that they were entered.

E.g. the user keys in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (for their numbers)
The program should then print out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (by accessing each element in order from the array).

##WEEK16C.ASM

Change the program so it prints every second element in the array. The array elements are to be printed in the order they were entered.

##WEEK16D.ASM

Change the program so it reads in 10 characters instead of 10 numbers. The array elements are to be printed out in the order they were entered.

 
##WEEK16E.ASM

Write a program in assembly to allow the user to input their name, which will be stored in an array and then the user by their name.

Sample input/output
Enter your name:
John
Hello John

Sample input/output
Enter your name:
Mary
Hello Mary

##WEEK16F.ASM

Write a program in assembly to allow the user to input their name, which will be stored in an array.

Then give the user four options as follows:

1. Convert name to lowercase
2. Convert name to UPPERCASE
3. Print name in correct order
4. Print name in reverse order

If the user chooses 1, go through all the array elements and convert them to lowercase.

If the user chooses 2, go through all the array elements and convert them to UPPERCASE.

If the user chooses 3 – print the letters from their name in the order they were entered.
If the user chooses 4 – print the letters from their name in the reverse order from the way they were entered.
